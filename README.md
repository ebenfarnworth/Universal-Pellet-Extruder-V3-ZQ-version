# Universal-Pellet-Extruder-V3-ZQ-version
This a rework of Mahor's pellet extruder v3. Aiming to overcome the following challenges: 

 * **Stability** - the original design is a bit wobbly and flexible when mounted to the CR10, you can see in some of Maho's videos he has used aluminium to make the front and back plates, but as I don't have the tools to do this I wanted a 3D printed solution. 
 * **Dust and mess** - if your active cooling is blowing air into the hopper and you're printing with shredded waste plastic then you end up with bits of plastic getting blown everywhere. I wanted a different location for cooling (this is not a problem with pellets). 
 * **Prevent blockage** - shredded waste plastic is very high friction and the pieces of it are very light so it dose not flow very well. 
 * **Make it easy to mount to my CR10** - now it mounts directly.
